Cross-platform detection tools (Bash + Windows Batch) to identify indicators of compromise from the September 2025 Shai-Hulud npm supply chain attack that affected 517+ npm packages. This self-replicating worm represents one of the most severe JavaScript supply chain attacks to date, surpassing previous incidents like the chalk/debug compromises, color-name attacks, and eslint package hijacking. The scripts currently detect 540+ confirmed compromised package versions, including popular packages like `@ctrl/tinycolor` with 2 million weekly downloads.

## Overview

The Shai-Hulud attack is a sophisticated self-replicating worm that compromises npm packages through stolen maintainer credentials. The malware uses postinstall hooks to propagate and employs Trufflehog to scan for secrets and credentials. This script detects multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs) to help identify if your system has been affected.

## Quick Start

### Unix/Linux/macOS (Bash)
```bash
# Clone the repository (required for compromised package list)
git clone https://github.com/Metyis-Global/shai-hulud-detect.git
cd shai-hulud-detect

# Make the script executable
chmod +x shai-hulud-detector.sh

# Scan your project for Shai-Hulud indicators
./shai-hulud-detector.sh /path/to/your/project

# For comprehensive security scanning
./shai-hulud-detector.sh --paranoid /path/to/your/project
```

### Windows (Batch) - **NEW v2.0.0 Enhanced**
```batch
# Clone the repository (required for compromised package list)
git clone https://github.com/Metyis-Global/shai-hulud-detect.git
cd shai-hulud-detect

# Scan your project for Shai-Hulud indicators
shai-hulud-detector.bat C:\path\to\your\project

# For comprehensive security scanning with advanced features
shai-hulud-detector.bat --paranoid C:\path\to\your\project
```

**‚ú® New in v2.0.0**: The Windows Batch script now includes all advanced features:
- üîç **File content previews** for HIGH RISK findings
- üìä **Risk level categorization** (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Investigation commands** for suspicious Git branches and repositories
- ‚ö° **Optimized performance** with progress indicators during package loading
- üìù **Enhanced reporting** with explanatory notes and truncated paranoid results

## What it Detects

### High Risk Indicators
- **Malicious workflow files**: `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`
- **Known malicious file hashes**: Files matching SHA-256 hash `46faab8ab153fae6e80e7cca38eab363075bb524edd79e42269217a083628f09`
- **Compromised package versions**: Specific versions of 517+ packages known to be compromised
- **Suspicious postinstall hooks**: Package.json files with postinstall scripts containing curl, wget, or eval commands
- **Trufflehog activity**: Files containing trufflehog references or credential scanning patterns
- **Shai-Hulud repositories**: Git repositories named "Shai-Hulud" (used for data exfiltration)

### Medium Risk Indicators
- **Suspicious content patterns**: References to `webhook.site` and the malicious endpoint `bb8ca5f6-4175-45d2-b042-fc9ebb8170b7`
- **Suspicious git branches**: Branches named "shai-hulud"
- **Compromised namespaces**: Packages from namespaces known to be affected (@ctrl, @crowdstrike, @art-ws, @ngx, @nativescript-community)

## Compromised Packages Detected

The script detects compromised packages from the Shai-Hulud attack, which affected 517+ packages total. **Our current detection covers 540+ confirmed compromised packages** with specific version numbers, plus broader namespace detection.

### Package Detection Method

The script loads compromised packages from an external file (`compromised-packages.txt`) which contains:
- **540+ confirmed compromised package versions** with exact version numbers
- **11 affected namespaces** for broader detection of packages from compromised maintainer accounts

### Key Compromised Packages Include
- `@ctrl/tinycolor@4.1.0, 4.1.1, 4.1.2` - Primary attack vector (2M+ weekly downloads)
- `@art-ws/*` packages (16+ packages) - Art workspace utilities
- `@crowdstrike/*` packages (25+ packages) - CrowdStrike-related packages
- `@nativescript-community/*` packages (40+ packages) - NativeScript community tools
- `ngx-bootstrap`, `angulartics2`, `koa2-swagger-ui` - Popular standalone packages

### Affected Namespaces (Complete List)
- `@ctrl/*` - Control utility packages
- `@crowdstrike/*` - CrowdStrike-related packages
- `@art-ws/*` - Art workspace packages
- `@ngx/*` - Angular-related packages
- `@nativescript-community/*` - NativeScript community packages
- `@ahmedhfarag/*`, `@operato/*`, `@teselagen/*`, `@things-factory/*`, `@hestjs/*`, `@nstudio/*` - Additional affected namespaces

### Maintaining and Updating the Package List

**Important**: The Shai-Hulud attack was self-replicating, meaning new compromised packages may still be discovered. The compromised packages list is stored in `compromised-packages.txt` for easy maintenance:

- **Format**: `package_name:version` (one per line)
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Updates**: The file can be updated as new compromised packages are discovered
- **Fallback**: If the file is missing, the script uses a core embedded list

### Staying Updated on New Compromised Packages

Check these security advisories regularly for newly discovered compromised packages:

- **[StepSecurity Blog](https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised)** - Original comprehensive analysis
- **[Semgrep Security Advisory](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/security-advisory-npm-packages-using-secret-scanning-tools-to-steal-credentials/)** - Detailed technical analysis
- **[JFrog Security Research](https://jfrog.com/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack-new-compromised-packages-detected/)** - Ongoing detection of new packages
- **[Wiz Security Blog](https://www.wiz.io/blog/shai-hulud-npm-supply-chain-attack)** - Attack analysis with package appendix
- **[Socket.dev Blog](https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages)** - CrowdStrike package analysis

### How to Add Newly Discovered Packages

1. Check the security advisories above for new compromised packages
2. Add them to `compromised-packages.txt` in the format `package_name:version`
3. Test the script to ensure detection works
4. Consider contributing updates back to this repository

**Coverage Note**: The Shai-Hulud attack affected 517+ packages total. Our detection now covers 540+ specific compromised package versions, which represents **comprehensive coverage** of the known compromised packages. Combined with namespace-based detection, this provides excellent protection against the attack. The higher number reflects multiple compromised versions of the same packages (e.g., @operato/board versions 9.0.36 through 9.0.46).

### Core vs Paranoid Mode

**Core Mode (Default)**
- Focuses specifically on Shai-Hulud attack indicators
- Recommended for most users checking for this specific threat
- Clean, focused output with minimal false positives

**Paranoid Mode (`--paranoid`)**
- Includes all core Shai-Hulud detection PLUS additional security checks
- Adds typosquatting detection and network exfiltration pattern analysis
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Paranoid features are general security tools, not specific to Shai-Hulud
- May produce more false positives from legitimate code
- Useful for comprehensive security auditing

## Requirements

### For Bash Script (Unix/Linux/macOS)
- macOS or Unix-like system
- Bash shell
- Standard Unix tools: `find`, `grep`, `shasum`

### For Batch Script (Windows)
- Windows 10/11
- Command Prompt (cmd.exe) or PowerShell
- Standard Windows tools: `findstr`, `certutil`

## Output Interpretation

### Clean System
```
‚úÖ No indicators of Shai-Hulud compromise detected.
Your system appears clean from this specific attack.
```

### Compromised System
The script will show:
- **üö® HIGH RISK**: Definitive indicators of compromise
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM RISK**: Suspicious patterns requiring manual review
- **Summary**: Count of issues found

### What to Do if Issues are Found

#### High Risk Issues
- **Immediate action required**
- Update or remove compromised packages
- Review and remove malicious workflow files
- Scan for credential theft
- Consider full system audit

#### Medium Risk Issues
- **Manual investigation needed**
- Review flagged files for legitimacy
- Check if webhook.site usage is intentional
- Verify git branch purposes

## Testing

The repository includes test cases to validate both scripts:

### Bash Testing (Unix/Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Test on clean project (should show no issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/clean-project

# Test on infected project (should show multiple issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/infected-project

# Test on mixed project (should show medium risk issues)
./shai-hulud-detector.sh test-cases/mixed-project
```

### Batch Testing (Windows)
```batch
# Test on clean project (should show no issues)
shai-hulud-detector.bat test-cases\clean-project

# Test on infected project (should show multiple issues)
shai-hulud-detector.bat test-cases\infected-project

# Test on mixed project (should show medium risk issues)
shai-hulud-detector.bat test-cases\mixed-project
```

## How it Works

The script performs these comprehensive checks:

1. **Package Database Loading**: Loads the complete list of 517+ compromised packages from `compromised-packages.txt`
2. **Workflow Detection**: Searches for `shai-hulud-workflow.yml` files in `.github/workflows/`
3. **Hash Verification**: Calculates SHA-256 hashes of JavaScript/JSON files against known malicious hashes
4. **Package Analysis**: Parses `package.json` files for specific compromised versions and affected namespaces
5. **Postinstall Hook Detection**: Identifies suspicious postinstall scripts that could be used for malware propagation
6. **Content Scanning**: Greps for suspicious URLs, webhook endpoints, and malicious patterns
7. **Trufflehog Activity Detection**: Looks for evidence of credential scanning tools and secret harvesting
8. **Git Analysis**: Checks for suspicious branch names and repository names
9. **Repository Detection**: Identifies "Shai-Hulud" repositories used for data exfiltration
10. **Package Integrity Checking**: Analyzes package-lock.json and yarn.lock files for compromised packages and suspicious modifications

## Limitations

- **Hash Detection**: Only detects files with the exact known malicious hash
- **Package Versions**: Detects specific compromised versions and namespace warnings, but new compromised versions may not be detected
- **False Positives**: Legitimate use of webhook.site, Trufflehog for security, or postinstall hooks will trigger alerts
- **Worm Evolution**: The self-replicating nature means new variants may emerge with different signatures
- **Coverage**: May not detect all 517+ compromised packages or future iterations of the attack
- **Package Integrity**: Relies on lockfile analysis to detect compromised packages, but sophisticated attacks may evade detection

## Contributing

If you discover additional IoCs or compromised packages related to the Shai-Hulud attack, please update the arrays in the script and test thoroughly.

## Security Note

This script is for **detection only**. It does not:
- Automatically remove malicious code
- Fix compromised packages
- Prevent future attacks

Always verify findings manually and take appropriate remediation steps.

## Latest Threat Intelligence Updates
